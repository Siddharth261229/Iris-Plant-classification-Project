# Iris-Plant-classification-Project
Utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify iris plants based on the famous Iris dataset. Preprocessed data and split into training and test sets. Implemented SVM with various kernels (RBF, linear, polynomial, sigmoid) and evaluated model performance using confusion matrices. Achieved effective classification of iris species.
